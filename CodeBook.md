##Procedure
The the `run_analysis.r` script follows the following procedure:
* The training and test sets are merged
* The mean and standard deviation measurements are extracted for each measurement
* Descriptive activity names are assigned to  the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
